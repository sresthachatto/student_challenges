            Cheese is a super interesting food. About 10 Pounds of Milk Goes Into Every Pound of Cheese.Cheese
            is great for your teeth. Eating cheese before you go to bed can help you sleep. Scientists have only recently 
            discovered what created the holes in cheese- tiny flakes of hay in the milk.
